class: it is a template in which all the 
format is already typed you just need to enter 
the required details.

object: it is the instance of class. 
A template is filled with
all the details and now it is called object.

example: bank form is a class 
while the same filled form is called object.

Note that, object is created from class.

OOP follows the conecpt of DRY
that is Do not Repeat Yourself.
there's no need to re-write the snippet.
